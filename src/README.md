Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Documentation:

The project involved having pointers and using their addresses and values to create a tokenizer and its history.

There is the file tokenizer.c to control the handling of strings as input, and there is the file history.c to be able to see a preview of previous tokenized strings.

The tokenizer file contains all the functions defined in tokenizer.h.
The file has multiple methods that help with the tokenizing implementation. the **tokenize functino is the one that is called when the user gives a string to tokenize. It conuts the number of tokens for future use. It then allocates memory for the pointers in the array. If there are no tokens, then it returns "Memory allocation failed" as a message and it exits the program.
